# Smart Bike Mileage and Speed Calculator 🏍️

This is a simple C++ program to calculate:
- Mileage of a bike (km/l)
- Required speed to cover a distance in a given time (km/h)
- Expected time of arrival (in 24-hour format)

---

## 📁 Project Files
- **mileage_calculator.cpp** - The main program file with the C++ code.
- **README.md** - Project information and usage guide.

---

## 🔧 How to Run the Program
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler like **g++** installed.
2. Open the terminal in the project folder.
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ mileage_calculator.cpp -o mileage_calculator
Run the program:
bash
Copy code
./mileage_calculator  # On Windows, use: mileage_calculator.exe
📦 Example Input and Output
vbnet
Copy code
Enter the speed of the bike (in km/h): 60
Enter the time taken to reach the destination (in hours): 2
Enter the amount of fuel consumed (in liters): 2
Enter the total distance to the destination (in km): 120
Enter the time the journey started (in hours, 24-hour format): 8

The bike's mileage is: 60 km/l
The required speed to reach the destination in time is: 60 km/h
The expected time to reach the destination is: 10 hours (24-hour format)
